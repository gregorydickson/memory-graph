# MemoryGraph Workplan Index

**Last Updated**: 2025-12-07
**Current Version**: v0.10.0 (in progress)
**Test Status**: 1,338 tests passing
**Purpose**: Central index for all workplans organized by priority and dependency

## ⚠️ Context Budget Principle (2025-12-07)

**Every MCP tool must justify its context overhead.**

| Metric | Budget |
|--------|--------|
| MCP tool definition | ~1-1.5k tokens each |
| Current total (Core) | ~9.6k tokens (9 tools) |
| Current total (Extended) | ~11k tokens (12 tools) |
| Target overhead | <15% of context window |

### Before Adding New MCP Tools

1. **Estimate cost**: ~1-1.5k tokens per tool
2. **Evaluate uniqueness**: Does this duplicate existing functionality?
3. **Assess frequency**: Expected usage > 10% of sessions?
4. **Calculate ROI**: value / context_cost > 0.5

### Recent Decisions

- **12-WORKPLAN**: Cut 5/6 navigation tools (saved ~5.5k tokens)
- **13-WORKPLAN**: MCP tools deferred pending usage review

---

## Overview

Workplans are numbered and organized for sequential execution by coding agents. Each workplan is designed to be:
- **Readable in one session** (~130-500 lines)
- **Self-contained** with clear prerequisites
- **Actionable** with markdown checkboxes
- **File-specific** with absolute paths where relevant
- **Context-aware** with MCP tool budgets considered

## Execution Recommendations

### For Coding Agents

**v0.10.0 Track (Competitive Features)**:
1. Start with **12-WORKPLAN** (Semantic Navigation) - validates our graph-first approach
2. Then **13-WORKPLAN** (Bi-Temporal Schema) - learn from Graphiti
3. Release v0.10.0 with both features

**v1.0.0 Track (Cloud Launch)**:
1. Start with **14-WORKPLAN** (Cloud Infrastructure) - foundation for everything
2. Then **15-WORKPLAN** (Authentication) - critical for cloud
3. Parallel: **16-WORKPLAN** (SDK) and **17-WORKPLAN** (Website)
4. Release v1.0.0 with cloud platform live

**v1.1.0 Track (Team Features)**:
1. After v1.0.0 launched, work on **18-WORKPLAN** (Team Sync)
2. Release v1.1.0 with real-time collaboration

**Parallel Execution**:
- **0-WORKPLAN-MARKETING**: Can run in parallel with ALL development work
- **16-WORKPLAN** and **17-WORKPLAN**: Can be worked on in parallel
- **6-WORKPLAN**: Defer until multi-tenancy is needed (enterprise customers)
